Proxy utilizing Shadowsocks
===========================

This is a Fyuneru proxy utilizing Shadowsocks. This proxy itself manages the
configurations of Shadowsocks by passing proper command-line arguments directly
to Shadowsocks.

We will use Shadowsocks to provide us a high-performance(as of 2015-08) UDP
proxy. It may be also desirable to set up multiple Shadowsocks tunnels on
different frontend servers to hide the true IP of your server.
